This document defines the behaviors, accountability, and billionaire examples for each Pillar.

---

## Pillar 1: Reality Distortion

### What Billionaires Actually Do
- They don't pitch a business. They paint an inevitable future and position themselves at the center of it.
- They make people feel like they're missing out by not joining.
- They practice and refine their vision articulation until it's instinct.

### The Behavior
- Craft a vision statement that creates urgency and inevitability
- Practice articulating it in 60 seconds or less
- Test it on 10 people. Track reactions. Refine.

### What Billionaireable Should Ask
- "What's the future you're creating? Say it in one sentence."
- "Who loses if you succeed?"
- "Why would someone bet their career on you?"

### Accountability
- User must record themselves delivering their vision pitch
- Billionaireable reviews the language, gives feedback
- No moving to Pillar 2 until the pitch passes

### Billionaires Who Do This
| Name | Company | How They Do It |
|------|---------|----------------|
| Steve Jobs | Apple | "Reality distortion field" - convinced teams and markets that impossible timelines and products were inevitable. Documented by Andy Hertzfeld and others who worked with him. |
| Elon Musk | Tesla, SpaceX | Sells futures that don't exist yet (Mars colonization, full self-driving). Raises billions against visions, not products. |
| Sara Blakely | Spanx | Pitched her vision to Neiman Marcus in person. No prototype, just conviction. Built $1B company. |
